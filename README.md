_[Ably](https://ably.com) is the platform that powers synchronized digital experiences in realtime. Whether attending an event in a virtual venue, receiving realtime financial information, or monitoring live car performance data – consumers simply expect realtime digital experiences as standard. Ably provides a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime for more than 250 million devices across 80 countries each month. Organizations like Bloomberg, HubSpot, Verizon, and Hopin depend on Ably’s platform to offload the growing complexity of business-critical realtime data synchronization at global scale. For more information, see the [Ably documentation](https://ably.com/documentation)._

## Supported platforms

- Android
- iOS
- Push notifications, [check support section](#push-notifications)

## Requirements

- Flutter 2.5.0 or higher
- iOS 10 or newer
- Android API Level 19 (Android 4.4, KitKat) or newer

This project uses Java 8 language features, utilizing [Desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)
to support lower versions of the Android runtime (i.e. API Levels prior to 24).

If your project needs support for SDK Version lower than 24, Android Gradle Plugin 4.0.0+ must be used.
You might also need to upgrade [gradle distribution](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-plugin) accordingly.

## Installation

### Specify Dependency

In `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ably_flutter: ^1.2.33
```

### Import the package

```dart
import 'package:ably_flutter/ably_flutter.dart' as ably;
```

### Updating to a newer version

When increasing the version of `ably_flutter` in your `pubspec.yaml`, if there are breaking changes, follow the [updating / migration guide](UPDATING.md).

## Usage

Please check [demo code snippets](example/example.md) and [flutter example app](./CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-example) for more detailed usage.

### Authentication

#### Authentication using API Key

```dart
// Create an instance of ClientOptions with Ably key
final clientOptions = ably.ClientOptions(key: '<KEY>');

// Use ClientOptions to create Realtime or REST instance
ably.Realtime realtime = ably.Realtime(options: clientOptions);
ably.Rest rest = ably.Rest(options: clientOptions);
```

Also see docs:
[Auth and Security: Basic authentication](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication/#basic-authentication)

#### Token Authentication

Supplying a `TokenCallback`:

```dart
// Create an instance of ClientOptions with Ably token and authCallback
ably.ClientOptions clientOptions = ably.ClientOptions(
    key: '<TOKEN>', 
    clientId: '<CLIENT>', // Optional
    authCallback: (ably.TokenParams tokenParams) async {
        // `createTokenRequest` should be implemented to communicate with user server
        ably.TokenRequest tokenRequest = await createTokenRequest(tokenParams);
        // `authCallback` has to return an instance of TokenRequest
        return tokenRequest;
    }
);

// Use ClientOptions to create Realtime or REST instance
ably.Realtime realtime = ably.Realtime(options: clientOptions);
ably.Rest rest = ably.Rest(options: clientOptions);
```

Also see docs:
[Auth and Security: Token authentication](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication/#token-authentication)

### Realtime instance

    });
```

#### Retrieve connection id, state etc
```dart
String connectionId = realtime.connection.id;
ConnectionState state = realtime.connection.state;
String recoveryKey = await realtime.connection.createRecoveryKey(); // https://ably.com/docs/connect/states?q=recovery#connection-state-recover-options

// For Realtime
RealtimeChannelOptions realtimeChannelOptions = ably.RealtimeChannelOptions(cipherParams: cipherParams);
RealtimeChannel channel = realtime.channels.get("channel-name");
channel.setOptions(realtimeChannelOptions)

// For REST
RestChannelOptions restChannelOptions = ably.RestChannelOptions(cipherParams: cipherParams);
RestChannel channel = rest.channels.get("channel-name");
channel.setOptions(restChannelOptions)
```

## Known limitations

### Missing features

Features that we do not currently support, but we do plan to add in the future:

- Ably token generation ([#105](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/issues/105))
- REST and Realtime Stats ([#106](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/issues/106))
- Push Notifications Admin ([#109](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/issues/109))

### RTE6a compliance

Using the Streams based approach doesn't fully conform with
[RTE6a](https://docs.ably.com/client-lib-development-guide/features/#RTE6a)
from our
[client library features specification](https://docs.ably.com/client-lib-development-guide/features/).

```dart
StreamSubscription subscriptionToBeCancelled;

// Listener registered 1st
realtime.connection.on().listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
  if (stateChange.event == ably.ConnectionEvent.connected) {
    await subscriptionToBeCancelled.cancel();       // Cancelling 2nd listener
  }
});

// Listener registered 2nd
subscriptionToBeCancelled = realtime.connection.on().listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
  print('State changed');
});
```

In the example above, the 2nd listener is cancelled when the 1st listener is notified about the "connected" event.
As per
[RTE6a](https://docs.ably.com/client-lib-development-guide/features/#RTE6a),
the 2nd listener should also be triggered.
It will not be as the 2nd listener was registered after the 1st listener and stream subscription is cancelled immediately after 1st listener is triggered.

This wouldn't have happened if the 2nd listener had been registered before the 1st was.

#### The Workaround - Cancelling using delay

Instead of `await subscriptionToBeCancelled.cancel();`, use

```dart
Future<void>.delayed(Duration.zero, () {
    subscriptionToBeCancelled.cancel();
});
```

## Push Notifications

By default, push-related components in the sample app won't work on Android, because of a dummy [google-services.json](example/android/app/src/google-services.json) file. In order to use push messaging features of Ably SDK, additional FCM/APNS configuration is required.

See [PushNotifications.md](PushNotifications.md) for detailed information on getting PN working with the example app.

## Feature support

See Ably [feature support matrix](https://ably.com/download/sdk-feature-support-matrix) for a list of features supported by this SDK.
