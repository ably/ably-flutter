# Ably Flutter Plugin

A
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
plugin wrapping the
[ably-cocoa](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa) (iOS)
and
[ably-java](https://github.com/ably/ably-java) (Android)
client library SDKs for [Ably](https://ably.io/), the realtime data delivery platform.

Ably provides the best infrastructure and APIs to power realtime experiences at scale, delivering billions of realtime messages everyday to millions of end users.
We handle the complexity of realtime messaging so you can focus on your code.

We're busy working on this repository at the moment and we're doing that work in the public domain so that you can watch or
[contribute](#contributing).

Get in touch if you are interested in using Ably from your Flutter apps.
We have our own ideas for how we build out this plugin but we would love to hear from you if there's a feature or capability in particular that you think we should prioritise.

## Contributing

We have some [Developer Notes](DeveloperNotes.md), but we're still learning too so they'll only help you so far, in fact there's probably a lot you can teach us!

Your pull requests are welcome but please keep them manageable and focussed.
Equally your input on any pull requests we have in flight at any given time is invaluable to us, so please get involved.

Thanks! :grin:
