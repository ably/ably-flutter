_[Ably](https://ably.com) is the platform that powers synchronized digital experiences in realtime. Whether attending an event in a virtual venue, receiving realtime financial information, or monitoring live car performance data – consumers simply expect realtime digital experiences as standard. Ably provides a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime for more than 250 million devices across 80 countries each month. Organizations like Bloomberg, HubSpot, Verizon, and Hopin depend on Ably’s platform to offload the growing complexity of business-critical realtime data synchronization at global scale. For more information, see the [Ably documentation](https://ably.com/documentation)._

## Overview

A [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) plugin for [Ably](https://www.ably.com),
built on top of Ably's [iOS](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa) and [Android](https://github.com/ably/ably-java) SDKs.

## Running the example

### Authorization in the example app

There are two different ways the example application can be configured to use Ably services:

1. Without the Ably SDK key: the application will request a sandbox key provision from Ably server at startup, but be aware that:

    - provisioned key may not support all features available in Ably SDK.
    - provisioned keys aren't able to use Ably push notifications. This feature requires APNS and FCM identifiers to be registered for Ably instance, which can't be done with sandbox applications
    - provisioned key will change on application restart

2. With the Ably SDK key: you can create a free account on [ably.com](https://ably.com/) and then use your API key from there in the example app. This approach will give you much more control over the API capabilities and grant access to development console, where API communication can be conveniently inspected.

#### Android Studio / IntelliJ Idea

Under the run/ debug configuration drop down menu, click `Edit Configurations...`. Duplicate the `Example App (Duplicate and modify)` configuration. Leave the "Store as project file" unchecked to avoid committing your Ably API key into a repository. Update this new run configuration's `additional run args` with your ably API key. Run or debug the your new run/ debug configuration.

![Run/Debug Configurations window in Android Studio](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/raw/main/images/run-configuration-2.png)

#### Visual Studio Code

- Under `Run and Debug`,
  - Select the gear icon to view [launch.json](.vscode/launch.json)
  - Find `Example App` launch configuration
  - Add your Ably API key to the `configurations.args`, i.e. replace `replace_with_your_api_key` with your own Ably API key.
  - Choose a device to launch the app:
    - to launch on a device, make sure it is the only device plugged in.
    - to run on a specific device when you have multiple plugged in, add another element to the `configuration.args` value, with `--device-id=replace_with_device_id`. Make sure to replace `replace_with_your_device` with your device ID from `flutter devices`.
- From `Run and Debug` select the `Example App` configuration and run it

#### Command Line using the Flutter Tool

- Change into the example app directory: `cd example`
- Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
- Launch the application: `flutter run --dart-define ABLY_API_KEY=put_your_ably_api_key_here`, remembering to replace `put_your_ably_api_key_here` with your own API key.
  - To choose a specific device when more than one are connected: get your device ID using `flutter devices`, and then running `flutter run --dart-define=ABLY_API_KEY=put_your_ably_api_key_here --device-id replace_with_device_id`

### Push Notifications

By default, push-related components in the sample app won't work on Android, because of a dummy [google-services.json](example/android/app/src/google-services.json) file. In order to use push messaging features of Ably SDK, additional FCM/APNS configuration is required.

See [PushNotifications.md](PushNotifications.md) for detailed information on getting PN working with the example app.

## Installation

See [requirements](#requirements) for a list of prerequisites

### Specify Dependency

In `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ably_flutter: ^1.2.27
```

### Import the package

```dart
import 'package:ably_flutter/ably_flutter.dart' as ably;
```

## Usage

Also available in [examples](example/example.md) for [pub.dev examples page](https://pub.dev/packages/ably_flutter/example)

### Authentication

#### Authentication using API Key

```dart
// Create an instance of ClientOptions with Ably key
final clientOptions = ably.ClientOptions(key: '<KEY>');

// Use ClientOptions to create Realtime or REST instance
ably.Realtime realtime = ably.Realtime(options: clientOptions);
ably.Rest rest = ably.Rest(options: clientOptions);
```

Also see docs:
[Auth and Security: Basic authentication](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication/#basic-authentication)

#### Token Authentication

Supplying a `TokenCallback`:

```dart
// Create an instance of ClientOptions with Ably token and authCallback
ably.ClientOptions clientOptions = ably.ClientOptions(
    key: '<TOKEN>', 
    clientId: '<CLIENT>', // Optional
    authCallback: (ably.TokenParams tokenParams) async {
        // `createTokenRequest` should be implemented to communicate with user server
        ably.TokenRequest tokenRequest = await createTokenRequest(tokenParams);
        // `authCallback` has to return an instance of TokenRequest
        return tokenRequest;
    }
);

// Use ClientOptions to create Realtime or REST instance
ably.Realtime realtime = ably.Realtime(options: clientOptions);
ably.Rest rest = ably.Rest(options: clientOptions);
```

Also see docs:
[Auth and Security: Token authentication](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication/#token-authentication)

## Requirements

### Flutter Runtime Requirements

Flutter 2.5.0 or higher is required.

### iOS Runtime Requirements

iOS 10 or newer.

### Android Runtime Requirements

API Level 19 (Android 4.4, KitKat) or newer.

_This project uses Java 8 language features, utilizing [Desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)
to support lower versions of the Android runtime (i.e. API Levels prior to 24)_

If your project needs support for SDK Version lower than 24, Android Gradle Plugin 4.0.0+ must be used.
You might also need to upgrade [gradle distribution](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-plugin) accordingly.

## Updating to a newer version

When increasing the version of `ably_flutter` in your `pubspec.yaml`, there may be breaking changes. To migrate code across these breaking changes, follow the [updating / migration guide](UPDATING.md).

## Known limitations

### Missing features

Features that we do not currently support, but we do plan to add in the future:

- Ably token generation ([#105](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/issues/105))
- REST and Realtime Stats ([#106](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/issues/106))
- Push Notifications Admin ([#109](https://github.com/ably/ably-flutter/issues/109))

### RTE6a compliance

Using the Streams based approach doesn't fully conform with
[RTE6a](https://docs.ably.com/client-lib-development-guide/features/#RTE6a)
from our
[client library features specification](https://docs.ably.com/client-lib-development-guide/features/).

```dart
StreamSubscription subscriptionToBeCancelled;

// Listener registered 1st
realtime.connection.on().listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
  if (stateChange.event == ably.ConnectionEvent.connected) {
    await subscriptionToBeCancelled.cancel();       // Cancelling 2nd listener
  }
});

// Listener registered 2nd
subscriptionToBeCancelled = realtime.connection.on().listen((ably.ConnectionStateChange stateChange) async {
  print('State changed');
});
```

In the example above, the 2nd listener is cancelled when the 1st listener is notified about the "connected" event.
As per
[RTE6a](https://docs.ably.com/client-lib-development-guide/features/#RTE6a),
the 2nd listener should also be triggered.
It will not be as the 2nd listener was registered after the 1st listener and stream subscription is cancelled immediately after 1st listener is triggered.

This wouldn't have happened if the 2nd listener had been registered before the 1st was.

#### The Workaround - Cancelling using delay

Instead of `await subscriptionToBeCancelled.cancel();`, use

```dart
Future<void>.delayed(Duration.zero, () {
    subscriptionToBeCancelled.cancel();
});
```
