      # Regarding getting the SHA for the HEAD of the branch underlying when triggered by a PR:
      # - github.sha is not helpful as it just gives us the SHA for the temporary merge commit created temporarily
      #   for this workflow run (the deployment then gets explicitly marked as "temporarily" deployed)
